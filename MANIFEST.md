### Manifest

This project is drawing from second-order cybernetic analysis, and more broadly complex systems analysis to create a simple datatype and tool for representing and analysing absurdly complicated, higher dimentional manifold latent information spaces. When applied to understanding the human mind, much of the latent space exists on top of our memory systems.

The human brain can be viewed as an extremely complex dynamic system, consisting of a vast number of interconnected neurons and neural networks. These intricate networks form hierarchical structures, where higher-level cognitive functions emerge from the collective behavior of lower-level neural processes. This aligns with the concept of complex systems discussed in [1], where the aggregate activity of numerous interacting entities gives rise to nonlinear, self-organizing behaviors that cannot be derived from the individual components alone.

One way to model and analyze such complex neural systems is through the use of latent spaces or state spaces, which are abstract representations of the system's dynamics and internal states. These latent spaces capture the underlying patterns and relationships among the various elements of the system, without necessarily explicitly modeling each individual component. In the context of the brain, these latent spaces could represent the collective activity patterns of neural populations, encoding information about cognitive processes, memories, and experiences.

[1] discusses the importance of hierarchical modeling and scenario calculus for studying the dynamics of complex systems. Similarly, in the realm of neuroscience, researchers often employ hierarchical models to understand the brain's functioning at multiple levels, from individual neurons to larger neural circuits and cognitive processes. These hierarchical models, combined with computational techniques like artificial neural networks and dynamic system analysis, can help uncover the latent spaces and dynamics underlying various cognitive functions, including memory formation, retrieval, and consolidation.

Furthermore, [1] highlights the concept of self-organization in complex systems, where the system autonomously changes its behavior and structure in response to environmental changes and internal dynamics. This parallels the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize its neural connections and activity patterns in response to new experiences and learning, a process known as neuroplasticity. The reorganization of neural networks and the emergence of new activity patterns in the brain's latent spaces could be viewed as a manifestation of self-organization in the context of memory and cognitive processes.

The goal of this model, in practice, is to create the second order cybernetic context such that systems become self-stabalizing.

In summary, the principles of cybernetic system analysis and the use of latent spaces align well with the study of the brain's complex dynamics and the neural mechanisms underlying memory. The hierarchical, self-organizing nature of neural systems, coupled with computational modeling techniques, can help researchers uncover the latent spaces that encode and represent cognitive processes, experiences, and memories within our neurology.
